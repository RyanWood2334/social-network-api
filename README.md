![Badge](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=License&message=MIT&color=<GREEN>)

## Description

This project is an API for an up and coming social network site. It uses mongoDB and mongoose, along with express to create routes and DB queries that are associated with users, thoughts, and reactions to said thoughts. You are able to create users, add friends (followers), update users, remove friends, and delete users. You are also able to create thoughts, update thoughts, create reactions, delete reactions, and delete thoughts. This is a fully functioning back-end application that is just anxiouslt awaiting a front end!

## User Story

As a user, I wanted a way to facilitate the creation of users, thoughts, and reactions using mongoDB and mongoose. Using MongoDB allows us to creatively store user's data, and query it easily when needed.
